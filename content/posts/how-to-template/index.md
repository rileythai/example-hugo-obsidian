How exactly does the template in Obsidian work?

<!--more-->

## How this works

Edit the template at `templates/example\ page.md` your own leisure, and depending on the archetypes you set. Make as many as you like, and hit `Ctrl+Shift+T` to insert them whereever/however you like.

## Notes on images and embed

See [the post on commiting](posts/commiting-from-obsidian) for a demo of this, but essentially the way Obsidian displays images is slightly different. Ensure you use the correct way.


```
![[image.png]] # obsidian style link

![something about image for html](image.png) # markdown style link
```

This may change for other things as well, like `LaTeX` embeds and similar.
