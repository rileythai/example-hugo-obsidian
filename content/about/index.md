A demo of using Hugo with obsidian. Nothing else to it.

Theme is the [Hugo Console](https://github.com/mrmierzejewski/hugo-theme-console) theme based on a modern and minimal [Terminal CSS](https://terminalcss.xyz/) framework.

## Live demo

* [https://rileythai.github.io/hugo-obsidian-template/about/]

## Configuration

Set theme parameter in your config file:

```
theme = "hugo-theme-console"
```

## Quick start

Hugo includes a development server, so you can view your changes as you go - very handy. Spin it up with the following command:

```
hugo serve
```

Now you can go to [http://localhost:1313](http://localhost:1313) and the theme should be visible.

## Example Site

To run this site yourself:

```
hugo server
```
